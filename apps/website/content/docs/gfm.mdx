Streamdown includes full support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) through [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). This extends standard Markdown with powerful features commonly used on GitHub and other modern Markdown platforms.

## Tables

Create formatted tables with alignment options:

```markdown
| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Tables | ✅ | Full support |
| Task Lists | ✅ | Interactive |
| Strikethrough | ✅ | ~~Like this~~ |
```

Renders as:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Tables | ✅ | Full support |
| Task Lists | ✅ | Interactive |
| Strikethrough | ✅ | ~~Like this~~ |

### Column Alignment

Control text alignment using colons in the separator row:

```markdown
| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| A | B | C |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
```

Result:

| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| A | B | C |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |

**Alignment Syntax:**
- `:---` - Left-aligned (default)
- `:---:` - Center-aligned
- `---:` - Right-aligned

### Table Features

Streamdown enhances tables with:
- **Responsive scrolling** - Tables scroll horizontally on narrow screens
- **Download button** - Export tables as CSV, TSV, or Markdown
- **Hover states** - Row highlighting for better readability
- **Proper spacing** - Optimized cell padding

### Complex Tables

Tables support inline formatting:

```markdown
| Name | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Streamdown** | A `react-markdown` replacement | ✅ Active |
| *Feature X* | Under development | 🚧 WIP |
| ~~Old Package~~ | Deprecated | ❌ Removed |
```

### Disabling Table Controls

You can disable the table download button:

```tsx
<Streamdown controls={{ table: false }}>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

## Task Lists

Create interactive todo lists:

```markdown
- [x] Setup project structure
- [x] Install dependencies
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production
```

Renders as:
- [x] Setup project structure
- [x] Install dependencies
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Task List Syntax

- `- [ ]` - Unchecked task (whitespace in brackets)
- `- [x]` - Checked task (lowercase x)
- `- [X]` - Also checked (uppercase X)

### Nested Task Lists

Task lists can be nested:

```markdown
- [ ] Phase 1: Setup
  - [x] Initialize repository
  - [x] Configure build tools
  - [ ] Setup CI/CD
- [ ] Phase 2: Development
  - [ ] Implement features
  - [ ] Write tests
```

### Task Lists in Different Contexts

Task lists work in various contexts:

```markdown
## Shopping List
- [ ] Milk
- [ ] Eggs
- [x] Bread

> **Note**: Here's a quote with tasks:
> - [x] Complete quote formatting
> - [ ] Add more examples
```

## Strikethrough

Mark text as deleted or outdated:

```markdown
~~This approach is deprecated~~

Use this **new method** instead.
```

Result: ~~This approach is deprecated~~

### Multiple Words

Strikethrough works across multiple words:

```markdown
~~This entire sentence is struck through.~~
```

### In Context

```markdown
**Before:** ~~500ms response time~~
**After:** 50ms response time ⚡
```

Result:
**Before:** ~~500ms response time~~
**After:** 50ms response time ⚡

## Autolinks

URLs and email addresses are automatically converted to links:

```markdown
Visit https://streamdown.ai for more info.

Contact us at hello@streamdown.ai
```

No need for explicit link syntax:

```markdown
Check out github.com/vercel/streamdown
```

### URL Protocols

Autolinks work with common protocols:
- `http://` and `https://`
- `ftp://`
- `mailto:`

```markdown
https://example.com
ftp://files.example.com
mailto:hello@example.com
```

## Line Breaks

In standard Markdown (and GFM), single newlines within a paragraph are treated as **soft breaks** and rendered as spaces — the lines are combined into one paragraph:

```markdown
This is line one
This is line two
This is line three
```

This renders as a single paragraph: "This is line one This is line two This is line three".

To force a visible line break, use one of these approaches:

### Two Trailing Spaces (Hard Break)

Add two or more spaces at the end of a line:

```markdown
Line one··
Line two··
Line three
```

(where `··` represents two spaces)

### Backslash (Hard Break)

Use a trailing backslash:

```markdown
Line one\
Line two\
Line three
```

### Using `remark-breaks`

If you want single newlines to always render as `<br>` without trailing spaces, add the [`remark-breaks`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-breaks) plugin:

```tsx
import remarkBreaks from "remark-breaks";
import { Streamdown, defaultRemarkPlugins } from "streamdown";

<Streamdown
  remarkPlugins={[...Object.values(defaultRemarkPlugins), remarkBreaks]}
>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```
