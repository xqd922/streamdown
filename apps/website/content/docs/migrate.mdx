Streamdown is a drop-in replacement for `react-markdown`, designed for AI-powered streaming. It supports all of the same props — `children`, `components`, `remarkPlugins`, `rehypePlugins`, `remarkRehypeOptions`, `allowElement`, `allowedElements`, `disallowedElements`, `skipHtml`, `unwrapDisallowed`, and `urlTransform` — so existing usage works without changes. On top of that, you get built-in syntax highlighting, GFM, math, mermaid diagrams, and prestyled typography.

## AI-assisted migration

You can use the following prompt with an AI coding assistant to automate the migration:

```md title="prompt.md"
Can you update this repo to use Streamdown instead of React Markdown.

Migration instructions:

- Replace `import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown"` (or equivalent) with `import { Streamdown } from "streamdown"`
- If type `Options` is used from react-markdown, create a new type `type Options = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Streamdown>`
- If type `Components` is used from react-markdown, create a new type `type Components = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Streamdown>['components']`
- If any of the following plugins are used, you can remove them as they're built in to Streamdown: rehype-harden, rehype-katex, rehype-raw, remark-cjk-friendly, remark-cjk-friendly-gfm-strikethrough, remark-gfm, remark-math. However, check that they're not being used elsewhere first.
- If code blocks or mermaid components exist, you can remove them too as they're built in to Streamdown. This may involve also uninstalling shiki / react-syntax-highlighter from the package.json.
- If the project is using a tailwind.config file, add the following to the `content` array: `'./node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js',` (ensuring the node modules path is correct).
- If the project is using Tailwind 4 globals.css, add the following near the top under imports: `@source "../node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js";` (ensuring the node modules path is correct).
- If the old ReactMarkdown component has custom components e.g. p tags, li tags, etc. you can delete them all. These are prestyled in Streamdown.
- If the old ReactMarkdown component uses `prose` classes, you can remove them too.
- When updating deps, use the local package manager as defined by the `packageManager` field in package.json or the lockfile e.g. pnpm-lock.yaml = pnpm.
- When installing Streamdown, use the latest versions of the packages (`streamdown`, `@streamdown/code`, etc.)
- If the old ReactMarkdown component is memoized / a "MemoizedReactMarkdown" (or equivalent) component exists, remove the memoization. Streamdown does this internally.
- **Final step: Check if the markdown wrapper file is now redundant. If it just re-exports Streamdown without any custom props, styling, or logic, delete the wrapper file and import Streamdown directly where needed.**
```

## What you get

By switching to Streamdown, you can remove a significant amount of boilerplate:

- **100% prop compatibility** — All `react-markdown` props are supported, including `allowElement`, `allowedElements`, `disallowedElements`, `skipHtml`, `unwrapDisallowed`, and `urlTransform`. Types like `Components`, `AllowElement`, `UrlTransform`, and `ExtraProps` are exported directly.
- **Built-in plugins** — GFM, math (KaTeX), raw HTML, and CJK support are included by default. No need for `remark-gfm`, `remark-math`, `rehype-katex`, `rehype-raw`, `rehype-harden`, `remark-cjk-friendly`, or `remark-cjk-friendly-gfm-strikethrough`.
- **Code highlighting** — Syntax highlighting with Shiki is built in. You can remove `shiki`, `react-syntax-highlighter`, or any custom code block components.
- **Mermaid diagrams** — Rendered automatically. No custom mermaid component needed.
- **Prestyled typography** — All HTML elements are styled out of the box. No `prose` classes or custom component overrides for basic elements like `p`, `li`, `h1`, etc.
- **Internal memoization** — No need for `MemoizedReactMarkdown` wrappers.

## Step-by-step migration

### 1. Install Streamdown

```package-install
npm i streamdown
```

### 2. Update imports

Replace `react-markdown` imports with Streamdown:

```tsx title="Before"
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";
```

```tsx title="After"
import { Streamdown } from "streamdown";
```

Streamdown exports the same types as `react-markdown`, so you can import them directly:

```tsx title="Before"
import type { Options, Components, ExtraProps } from "react-markdown";
```

```tsx title="After"
import type { Components, ExtraProps, AllowElement, UrlTransform } from "streamdown";
```

If you need a type for the full Streamdown props, use `StreamdownProps`:

```tsx
import type { StreamdownProps } from "streamdown";
```

### 3. Remove built-in plugins

If your project uses any of these plugins, you can uninstall them — they're built in to Streamdown:

- `rehype-harden`
- `rehype-katex`
- `rehype-raw`
- `remark-cjk-friendly`
- `remark-cjk-friendly-gfm-strikethrough`
- `remark-gfm`
- `remark-math`

<Callout type="warn">
  Check that these plugins aren't used elsewhere in your project before removing them.
</Callout>

### 4. Remove code block and mermaid components

Custom code block or mermaid diagram components can be deleted — Streamdown handles these natively. This may also allow you to uninstall `shiki` or `react-syntax-highlighter` from your `package.json`.

### 5. Remove custom component overrides

If the old `ReactMarkdown` component has custom component overrides for basic elements (e.g. `p`, `li`, `h1`), you can delete them. Streamdown prestyles all standard HTML elements.

Similarly, if the wrapper uses `prose` Tailwind classes, you can remove those too.

### 6. Remove memoization

If a `MemoizedReactMarkdown` (or equivalent) wrapper exists, remove it. Streamdown handles memoization internally.

### 7. Configure Tailwind CSS

Streamdown uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Add the source path so Tailwind picks up the classes:

**Tailwind v4** — add to your `globals.css`:

```css title="globals.css"
@source "../node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js";
```

**Tailwind v3** — add to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... your existing paths
    "./node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js",
  ],
};
```

Adjust the `node_modules` path based on your project structure. See [Tailwind CSS Configuration](/docs/getting-started#tailwind-css-configuration) for monorepo setups.

### 8. Clean up

Check if your markdown wrapper file is now redundant. If it just re-exports Streamdown without any custom props, styling, or logic, delete the wrapper and import Streamdown directly where needed.
