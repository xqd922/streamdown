Streamdown comes with beautiful, built-in typography styles powered by Tailwind CSS. All standard Markdown elements are styled out of the box, ensuring your content looks polished without additional configuration.

## Headings

Streamdown supports all six levels of Markdown headings with responsive sizing and proper spacing:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

Headings automatically include:
- Responsive font sizes that scale appropriately
- Proper font weights (semibold by default)
- Optimal line heights for readability
- Consistent vertical spacing

## Text Formatting

### Bold and Italic

Use standard Markdown syntax for emphasis:

```markdown
**Bold text** or __also bold__
*Italic text* or _also italic_
***Bold and italic***
```

### Strikethrough

GitHub Flavored Markdown strikethrough is fully supported:

```markdown
~~Crossed out text~~
```

### Inline Code

Inline code is styled with a subtle background and monospace font:

```markdown
Use the `Streamdown` component in your app.
```

## Links

Links are styled with underlines and appropriate colors:

```markdown
[Visit our website](https://streamdown.ai)
```

Features include:

```

```

> — Stephen Hawking
```

## Code Blocks

Code blocks receive syntax highlighting via Shiki:

````markdown
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
````

See the [Code Blocks](/docs/code-blocks) documentation for detailed configuration options.

## Images

Images are responsive and properly contained:

```markdown
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

Features:
- Responsive sizing
- Proper aspect ratio preservation
- Loading states
- Alt text for accessibility
- Broken image fallback with "Image not available" text

## Tables

Tables are fully styled with borders and hover states:

```markdown

| Math | ✓ |
```

See the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](/docs/gfm) documentation for more table features.

## Horizontal Rules

Create visual separators:

```markdown

```

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs receive proper spacing and line height for optimal readability:

```markdown
This is a paragraph with normal text flow. It automatically wraps and includes proper spacing between adjacent paragraphs.

This is a second paragraph with appropriate margin top spacing.
```
