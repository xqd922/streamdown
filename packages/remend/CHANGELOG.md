# remend

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fdd1351: Rework code-region detection and double-underscore counting.

  A shared single-pass scanner now classifies fences and inline code spans, replacing the per-character rescans that made healing quadratic on delimiter-heavy input. Fence and span detection follows CommonMark, so `~~~` fences, fences inside block quotes and list items, CRLF line endings, and multi-backtick spans are all recognized, and content inside code is never healed as prose.

  Double underscores are counted per maximal run with flanking rules, so identifiers containing `__` (like `snake__case`) no longer invent or swallow emphasis closers.

  Healing is now idempotent. Healed output re-heals to itself, and text-only link mode resolves every unmatched bracket in one call.

### Patch Changes

- cf0ac1c: Stop the incomplete-HTML-tag handler from truncating math expressions.

  `handleIncompleteHtmlTag` guarded against code blocks but not math, so an ordinary
  comparison inside math — `$$ I = \sum_{j<k} p_j $$` — matched the incomplete-tag
  pattern and deleted everything from the `<` to the end of the string. The trailing
  `$$` was then auto-closed by the katex handler, so KaTeX rendered a parse error and
  the rest of the message never reached the DOM.

  The handler now skips candidates inside math blocks (`$`, `$$`, `\(`, `\[`), matching
  the guard the emphasis handlers already had. Because the pattern is leftmost-matching,
  it also walks forward to later candidates instead of bailing out, so a genuine
  incomplete tag after a math expression is still stripped.

- e0ce123: Incomplete images during streaming now render a loading placeholder instead of being removed entirely. Incomplete images (e.g. `![alt](https://exampl`) are replaced with `![alt](streamdown:incomplete-image)` by remend, and the streamdown `ImageComponent` renders an animated skeleton for this special URL. This mirrors the existing behavior for incomplete links (`streamdown:incomplete-link`). The `streamdown` protocol is allowlisted for `img[src]` in the default sanitize schema so the sentinel survives rehype-sanitize + rehype-harden.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a99d675: Fix crash on iOS 16.0-16.2 / Safari < 16.3 by removing the lookbehind assertion from the single-tilde escape pattern (#519).

  JSCore on those versions doesn't support lookbehind (`(?<=...)`) and throws a `SyntaxError` while the module is being evaluated, before any user code runs, so there is no way to catch it. The preceding word character is now captured and written back in the replacement instead.

- 9f96409: Preserve complete italic emphasis when a closing asterisk is followed by word text.
- 8093f2a: Treat LaTeX paren and bracket math as protected math contexts during emphasis completion.
- 57c3089: Fix quadratic code-block scanning. `isInsideCodeBlock` now builds a linear-time position lookup (cached per text) instead of rescanning the whole prefix on every call, so handlers that probe many positions no longer degrade quadratically. Repairing an unclosed, bracket-heavy 58k-character code block drops from ~915ms to ~0.4ms per call.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e50b0c4: Add opt-in inline KaTeX completion (`$formula` → `$formula$`) via a new `inlineKatex` option that defaults to `false` to avoid ambiguity with currency symbols. Also fixes block KaTeX completion when streaming produces a partial closing `$`.
- 716a5f0: Escape single `~` between word characters to prevent false strikethrough rendering (e.g. `20~25°C` no longer renders as strikethrough). Adds a new `singleTilde` option (enabled by default) that can be disabled via `{ singleTilde: false }`.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- a725579: Fix emphasis completion handlers incorrectly closing bold/italic/strikethrough markers that appear inside complete inline code spans (e.g. `` `**bold` `` no longer gets a stray `**` appended outside the backticks).
