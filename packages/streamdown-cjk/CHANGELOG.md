# @streamdown/cjk

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 8cb3bc7: Re-linkify bare URLs that follow CJK punctuation when splitting GFM autolink literals (e.g. URLs separated by fullwidth semicolons).

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 6f1ea07: Updated `remark-cjk-friendly` and `remark-cjk-friendly-gfm-strikethrough` from v1.x to v2.x. The only breaking change in v2.0.0 is dropping Node.js 16 support, which Streamdown has already dropped (requires Node.js ≥18), so there is no actual impact. The actual code is identical to the latest v1.x release (v2.0.1 only added the ability to import package.json).

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 6b42a85: Remove CJS builds

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 0b80aed: Plugins
