# streamdown

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b14de4: Add a `disableAutolinkProtocols` prop to `<Streamdown>` for disabling GFM autolinking of specific URL protocols (e.g. `mailto`).

  ```tsx
  <Streamdown disableAutolinkProtocols={["mailto"]}>
    {"Contact us at hello@example.com"}
  </Streamdown>
  ```

  Bare emails and bare URLs whose protocol matches the list (case-insensitive, `"mailto"` and `"mailto:"` are equivalent) are unwrapped back to plain text. Explicit markdown links (`[text](url)`) are left as links, including when the label reconstructs the URL (e.g. `[foo@x.com](mailto:foo@x.com)`). When the prop is omitted, autolinking behavior is completely unchanged.

  Closes #607.

- b1965bb: feat: add `fallbackComponent` prop for missing map entries / `allowedTags`

  Adds a new `fallbackComponent` prop to `<Streamdown>`. When provided, it is
  used as a fallback renderer for any HTML tag or allowed custom tag that does
  not have an explicit entry in the `components` map:

  ```tsx
  <Streamdown
    allowedTags={{ mention: ["user_id"] }}
    fallbackComponent={({ node, children, ...props }) =>
      createElement(node!.tagName, props, children)
    }
  >
    {markdown}
  </Streamdown>
  ```

  `fallbackComponent` applies to custom tags declared via `allowedTags` (with no
  explicit component entry) and to standard HTML tags absent from the built-in
  component set (e.g. `<span>`, `<em>`, `<div>`, `<br>`). Built-in and explicit
  `components` entries always win — this is not a full unstyled mode.

  Refs #543

### Patch Changes

- c971f42: Wire `onCopy` and `onError` through default code and Mermaid copy controls via `controls.code.copy` and `controls.mermaid.copy`.
- 16e7e65: Export `defaultComponents` so custom `components` overrides can compose Streamdown's built-in renderers (styles, `data-streamdown`, link safety, code/mermaid/table behavior) instead of reimplementing them.
- 163c63b: fix(code-block): use absolute positioning for action buttons to fix click events in nested scroll containers

  Switches the code block action button wrapper from `position: sticky` to
  `position: absolute` (with `position: relative` on the container) so that
  hit-testing works correctly in layouts with multiple nested `overflow: auto`
  scroll containers. Previously, the `sticky` + `pointer-events-none/auto`
  pattern caused browsers to mis-route click events to the code block wrapper
  rather than the buttons when the component was embedded in 2+ nested scroll
  containers.

- e0ce123: Incomplete images during streaming now render a loading placeholder instead of being removed entirely. Incomplete images (e.g. `![alt](https://exampl`) are replaced with `![alt](streamdown:incomplete-image)` by remend, and the streamdown `ImageComponent` renders an animated skeleton for this special URL. This mirrors the existing behavior for incomplete links (`streamdown:incomplete-link`). The `streamdown` protocol is allowlisted for `img[src]` in the default sanitize schema so the sentinel survives rehype-sanitize + rehype-harden.
- e7a23ef: Render Mermaid diagrams one at a time while their code fence streams, pausing after each render for as long as it took, so a growing diagram no longer holds up the stream. Once the fence closes or the stream stops, the final diagram renders without a pause.
- 5504e50: Preserve literal HTML tags and character entities when copying or downloading tables as Markdown.
- 5b26c28: Speed up block parsing by lexing only block tokens and reusing already parsed blocks while a document streams.
- 18dcb20: Add a top-level `portal` prop for configuring the container used by Mermaid fullscreen, table fullscreen, and the built-in link safety modal.
- fdf4e33: Fix Mermaid diagrams so text is readable and diagrams auto-fit container.
  - Normalize SVG to remove responsive shrinking
  - Extract intrinsic size from viewBox
  - Add width-and-height auto-fit in PanZoom
  - Preserve user zoom/pan after initial fit
  - Add tests for SVG utilities and auto-fit behavior
- 53812cf: fix: unwrap a single paragraph child inside list items

  Loose list items from the markdown pipeline are often wrapped in a `<p>`. `MemoLi` now detects that sole paragraph child (including the memoized paragraph component) and renders its contents directly, so list items stay visually tight. Also updates the list animation retrigger test to match the unwrapped markup.

  Fixes #475

- a155a9e: Update `marked` from `^17.0.1` to `^18.0.11`.

  marked v18 no longer folds a block token's trailing blank line(s) into its own `raw`; that whitespace now surfaces as a separate `space` token immediately following the block (e.g. after `html`, `heading`, and `table` tokens). This changed the token stream shape that `parseMarkdownIntoBlocks` consumes, causing a dangling `space` token after a closed custom-tag HTML block to be emitted as its own standalone block. `parseMarkdownIntoBlocks` now folds a `space` token into the preceding block instead of pushing it as a new one, restoring v17-identical block boundaries and counts. The lossless `token.raw` concatenation invariant is preserved.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 49bd143: fix(animate): serialize streaming animation across blocks

  Word stagger now runs on a shared wall-clock timeline so sibling sections no longer fade in on top of each other during streaming. Related cleanup: trailing spaces stay inside animated spans (no early link underlines), animate wrappers drop when streaming ends, already-seen text stays steady under StrictMode, and un-animated streaming is no longer deferred behind a starvable transition.

  Inspired by #493, #531, and #536.

  Fixes #482
  Fixes #535
  Fixes #550
  Fixes #570

- b734cbf: - Add custom download filenames for code, table, and mermaid via the `controls` prop
  - Configure downloads with `download: { filename: "customName" }` while keeping boolean `true`/`false` to show or hide
  - Preserve automatic file-extension mapping based on language or export format
  - Remove the `codeDownload` prop in favor of the unified `controls` API
- 5faa6fa: Add `codeBlockMaxHeight` and `tableMaxHeight` props with streaming auto-scroll
- 4436b56: - Add `controls.table.csvSeparator` (`"," | ";" | "\t" | "auto"`) for table copy and download CSV
  - Reuse `tableDataToCSV` separator handling, including locale-aware `"auto"` mode
  - Improve CSV escaping to respect the selected separator for Excel compatibility

### Patch Changes

- 6ec3c48: fix(animate): animate inline code during streaming

  Skip the animate visitor on `pre` (and svg/math/annotation) only — not bare `code`. Fenced/highlighted blocks stay un-split via their `pre` ancestor; inline backtick spans now get the same per-word fade-in as surrounding prose.

  Fixes #594

- 725e390: Forward rest props through block code. The `code` component spread its rest props on the inline branch and dropped them on the block branch, so an attribute a consumer put on a fenced code element never reached the DOM. `CodeBlockBody` now takes part in that comparison, so a forwarded attribute updates instead of keeping the value it first rendered with.
- 7e82400: Fix `dir="auto"` in static mode to detect text direction per semantic block (instead of once for the whole document), keep code LTR, and use content-majority direction for mixed-script prose.
- fb5d7b9: Serialize Mermaid SVGs before download so HTML-style tags render as valid SVG markup.
- fe38e75: Added accessibility improvements for code block controls by adding aria labels to copy/download buttons and announcing copy success state for screen readers.
- b25dbdb: fix(custom-tags): render Markdown inside custom tags with multiline content

  Adds a preprocessing step (`preprocessCustomTags`) that normalizes multiline
  custom tags into a blank-line-sandwiched HTML block so CommonMark interrupts
  the raw-HTML block and parses the nested content as Markdown, with
  `parseMarkdownIntoBlocks` re-merging the interrupted open/content/close tokens
  so streaming still treats the whole custom tag as one block. Previously, when a
  custom tag contained multiline content (e.g. `<ai-thinking>
**bold**</ai-thinking>`), CommonMark treated the block as raw HTML, stripping
  Markdown formatting. Tags listed in `literalTagContent` are excluded from
  re-parsing.

  Closes #478

- 26a8440: Fix doubled `user-content-` prefix on footnote ids

  Footnote list items were rendered with `id="user-content-user-content-fn-1"` because both `remark-rehype` and `rehype-sanitize` default their `clobberPrefix` to `user-content-`, so the prefix was applied twice. Disabled `clobberPrefix` on `rehype-sanitize` so `remark-rehype` remains the single, consistent prefixer of both footnote ids and backref hrefs — restoring working footnote navigation.

- f7d1fb5: fix(table): add `data-streamdown="table-wrapper"` to fullscreen portal so copy/download dropdowns can find the table
- f0a726b: Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative SVG icon components so screen readers rely on parent button labels instead of unlabeled icons.
- 2ed2faa: Allow remend's `streamdown:` incomplete-link sentinel through the default sanitize schema so streamed incomplete links render as pending instead of harden `[blocked]`.
- 8fffa9d: Render the link safety modal through a portal to `document.body` so it is no longer nested inside the paragraph's `<p>` element. This fixes the React hydration error "In HTML, `<div>` cannot be a descendant of `<p>`" that occurred when a link with link safety enabled appeared inside a paragraph.
- 2733922: fix(mermaid): add aria-hidden to decorative SVG icons in mermaid toolbar buttons

  Mermaid toolbar buttons (download, fullscreen, pan/zoom controls) already have
  accessible titles/labels, but the inline SVG icons were exposed to the accessibility
  tree causing "Content with images must be labeled" warnings. Added aria-hidden={true}
  to all decorative icon elements in download-button, fullscreen-button, and pan-zoom
  components.

  Fixes #485

- 8d36719: fix(deps): remove `mermaid` as a hard runtime dependency

  This patch replaces the type import with a local structural type for `MermaidConfig` so no type-level coupling to the `mermaid` package remains in the distributed typings. Users who want fully-typed mermaid config can still `import type { MermaidConfig } from 'mermaid'` themselves; the structural type is compatible.

  Fixes #501

- ea02609: Fix: `shikiTheme` prop priority chain is now fully reachable.

  Previously, `shikiTheme` had a default value in the props destructuring (`= defaultShikiTheme`), making the `plugins?.code?.getThemes()` fallback unreachable in both orderings. The fix removes the destructuring default and moves it to the end of the nullish coalescing chain, so all three levels are reachable:

  1. Explicit `shikiTheme` prop (highest priority)
  2. Code plugin's `getThemes()` (second priority)
  3. Built-in `defaultShikiTheme` (final fallback)

- 9813dd6: Fix type declarations requiring a `shiki` install.

  `BundledLanguage`, `BundledTheme`, and `ThemeRegistrationAny` are now defined locally and re-exported from `streamdown`, so consumers can type-check without installing `shiki`. Runtime highlighting remains in `@streamdown/code`, which still depends on `shiki`.

- d893759: Fix mermaid fullscreen overlay accessibility and add stable selector

  - Add `data-streamdown="mermaid-fullscreen"` to fullscreen overlay for stable CSS targeting
  - Update fullscreen overlay semantics to match table fullscreen behavior
  - Change `role` from `button` to `dialog`
  - Add `aria-modal="true"` for correct screen reader modal behavior
  - Improve accessibility consistency between mermaid and table fullscreen overlays

- 79c8575: fix issue with list markers, task-list checkboxes, images, and hr animations
- a1a7142: feat: add image control options (`controls.image`) to disable hover overlay and download button on images

  Add `image` to the `controls` prop, matching existing `code`, `table`, and `mermaid` patterns:

  - `controls={{ image: false }}` hides the hover overlay and download button
  - `controls={{ image: { download: false } }}` keeps the hover overlay but hides the download button

- b250038: Fix accessibility warnings for Mermaid toolbar icon buttons:

  - Add `aria-hidden="true"` to all decorative SVG icons to hide them from screen readers
  - Add `aria-label` attributes to all icon-only buttons for proper screen reader announcements
  - Add translation keys (`zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `resetView`) for zoom controls

- 89c6877: Re-render memoized markdown components when their rendered output changes. The comparators compared source position, so a replacement of the same length — occupying the same lines and columns — was treated as unchanged and the component kept rendering the previous text.
- e7bdf57: fix(mermaid): render the download and copy controls inside the Mermaid fullscreen portal so they're reachable when the diagram is expanded
- 8f02c09: Fix table copy and download actions not working in fullscreen mode.

  - Support table lookup inside the fullscreen portal container.
  - Restore copy and download functionality for fullscreen tables.
  - Keep existing inline table controls behavior unchanged.

- f46cd3c: - Fixed table copy losing line breaks inside cells containing `<br>` elements.
  - Preserved multiline content during table data extraction.
  - Improved copied Markdown, CSV, and TSV output consistency for multiline cells.
  - Added coverage for `<br>` handling in table extraction.
- dc3f1d2: - Fix code block line wrapping when line numbers are disabled.
  - Ensure code block lines are rendered as block elements regardless of the `lineNumbers` setting.
  - Prevent multiple code lines from collapsing into a single visual line when `lineNumbers={false}`.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d6666b6: Add `lineNumbers` prop to disable line numbers in code blocks
- d4ec6c0: Add `meta` prop to `CustomRendererProps`. Custom renderers now receive the raw metastring from the code fence (everything after the language identifier, e.g. ` ```rust {1} title="foo" ` → `meta = '{1} title="foo"'`). The prop is optional (`meta?: string`) and is `undefined` when no metastring is present. Existing custom renderers are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- ac8d839: Add staggered `animation-delay` to streaming word/character animations so new content cascades in sequentially instead of all animating simultaneously. Configurable via the new `stagger` option (default 40ms). Set `stagger: 0` to restore the previous behavior.
- add5374: Enable horizontal scrolling on code blocks so long lines are accessible instead of being clipped by `overflow-hidden`.
- 75845c0: Fix unnecessary re-renders of code blocks during streaming updates.

  **Problem:** In streaming mode, when new content arrives (e.g. a paragraph is appended), completed code blocks that haven't changed were still re-rendering. This happened because the `Streamdown` component used inline object literals as default parameter values for `linkSafety` (`{ enabled: true }`). Every time `children` changed and `Streamdown` re-rendered, these inline defaults created new references, which caused the `contextValue` useMemo to recompute a new `StreamdownContext` object. Since React propagates context changes through `memo` boundaries, any context consumer inside a memoized `Block` (such as `CodeBlock`) would re-render even though the block's own props were unchanged.

  **Fix:** Extract the inline default values for `linkSafety` into module-level constants (`defaultLinkSafetyConfig`). This ensures referential stability across renders, so `contextValue` only recomputes when the actual values change — not just because `children` updated.

- 8b1c262: fix: prepend UTF-8 BOM to CSV downloads for Excel compatibility

  - `save()` now prepends `\uFEFF` for `text/csv` string content so Excel on
    Windows detects UTF-8 encoding instead of falling back to ANSI.
  - `TableDownloadButton` refactored to use `save()` instead of inline Blob
    creation, ensuring the public API also gets the BOM fix.

- b105c64: Fix custom tag content being prematurely split when content follows the opening tag on the same line and contains double newlines (`\n\n`). The preprocessor now ensures proper HTML block structure so the parser treats the entire tag as a single unit.
- 9e6f991: Increase dropdown z-index for table copy and download menus to prevent clipping by surrounding elements.
- 9c18748: docs: document required CSS custom properties (shadcn/ui design tokens) in README
- 7b62e9a: Replace Tailwind v4-only `*:last:` and `*:first:` variant syntax with `[&>*:last-child]:` and `[&>*:first-child]:` arbitrary variants for compatibility with both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4. Fixes caret rendering on every line instead of only the last child in v3.
- Updated dependencies [e50b0c4]
- Updated dependencies [716a5f0]
  - remend@1.3.0

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5edff75: Clarified Tailwind `@source` configuration for Streamdown and optional plugins.
  Updated documentation to keep the global `@source` for core `streamdown` only, move plugin `@source` guidance to plugin docs with examples, and add a caveat to include plugin entries only if installed.
- 57cd3b5: Add support for custom starting line numbers in code blocks via the `startLine` meta option.

  Code blocks can now specify a starting line number in the meta string:

  ````md
  ```js startLine=10
  const x = 1;
  ```
  ````

  This renders line numbers beginning at 10 instead of the default 1. The feature works by parsing the `startLine=N` value from the fenced-code meta string and applying `counter-reset: line N-1` to the `<code>` element.

- 57cd3b5: Add support for customizing icons via the `icons` prop on `<Streamdown>`.

  Users can override any subset of the built-in icons (copy, download, zoom, etc.) by passing a `Partial<IconMap>`:

  ```tsx
  import { Streamdown, type IconMap } from "streamdown";

  <Streamdown icons={{ CheckIcon: MyCheckIcon }}>{content}</Streamdown>;
  ```

  Unspecified icons fall back to defaults.

- 01d27e9: Add support for custom Shiki themes via a `themes` option on `createCodePlugin`, accepting a `[light, dark]` pair of bundled theme names or full theme registration objects.
- 2cf559d: Add a virtual `inlineCode` key to the `components` prop, allowing inline code spans to be styled independently from fenced code blocks without manually detecting block vs. inline context.
- 27c7b03: Export table action components (`TableCopyDropdown`, `TableDownloadButton`, `TableDownloadDropdown`) and utilities (`extractTableDataFromElement`, `tableDataToCSV`, `tableDataToTSV`, `tableDataToMarkdown`, `escapeMarkdownTableCell`, `TableData`), enabling custom table overrides to preserve copy/download interactivity.
- fb76275: Add a fullscreen overlay for tables with Escape/backdrop-click to close and scroll locking, controlled via `controls.table.fullscreen`. Copy and download controls remain available in the fullscreen view.
- b392fbe: Add `literalTagContent` prop that accepts an array of custom HTML tag names (e.g. `['mention']`) whose children should be treated as plain text, escaping markdown metacharacters so user-supplied labels aren't interpreted as formatting.
- c4c86fa: Add a `dir` prop that accepts `"ltr"`, `"rtl"`, or `"auto"`. When set to `"auto"`, each block's text direction is detected by scanning for the first strong Unicode character (Arabic, Hebrew, Thaana, etc.).
- 00872f0: Add a `prefix` prop that prepends a namespace to all generated Tailwind utility classes (e.g. `flex` becomes `tw:flex`), enabling Tailwind v4's `prefix()` feature for projects that need to avoid class name collisions.
- 401b901: Add support for custom renderers via `plugins.renderers`, allowing fenced code blocks with specific languages to be rendered by a custom component instead of the default `CodeBlock`.

### Patch Changes

- f398611: Add `onAnimationStart` and `onAnimationEnd` callback props that fire when streaming animation begins and completes, useful for coordinating UI state with the animation lifecycle.
- f2a7e51: Fix empty lines in syntax-highlighted code blocks collapsing into nothing by rendering a newline character for empty token rows, preserving whitespace when copying.
- 9ba8511: fix: prevent ordered list animation retrigger during streaming

  When streaming content contains multiple ordered (or unordered) lists,
  the Marked lexer merges them into a single block. As each new item appears
  the block is re-processed through the rehype pipeline, re-creating all
  `data-sd-animate` spans. This caused already-visible characters to re-run
  their CSS entry animation.

  Two changes address the root cause:

  1. **Per-block `prevContentLength` tracking** – each `Block` component
     now keeps a `useRef` with the content length from its previous render.
     Before each render the `animatePlugin.setPrevContentLength(n)` method is
     called so the rehype plugin can detect which text-node positions were
     already rendered. Characters whose cumulative hast-text offset falls below
     the previous raw-content length receive `--sd-duration:0ms`, making them
     appear in their final state instantly rather than re-animating.

  2. **Stable `animatePlugin` reference** – the `animatePlugin` `useMemo`
     now uses value-based dependency comparison instead of reference equality
     for the `animated` option object. This prevents the plugin from being
     recreated on every parent re-render when the user passes an inline object
     literal (e.g. `animated={{ animation: 'fadeIn' }}`). A stable reference
     is required because the rehype processor cache uses the function name as
     its key and always returns the first cached closure; only the original
     `config` object is ever read by the processor.

- 781178b: Add a granular `controls` prop that accepts a boolean to toggle all controls or an object with per-feature flags (`code`, `table`, `mermaid`) for fine-grained control over copy, download, fullscreen, and pan/zoom buttons.
- e129f09: Add a `translations` prop for overriding all user-facing UI strings (copy/download button labels, modal text, image alt text, etc.), enabling full i18n support.
- Updated dependencies [a725579]
  - remend@1.2.2

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 3657e42: Add `useIsCodeFenceIncomplete` hook for detecting incomplete code fences during streaming

  Custom components can now detect when the code fence in their block is still being streamed. This is useful for deferring expensive renders (syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams) until the code block is complete.

  ```tsx
  import { useIsCodeFenceIncomplete } from "streamdown";

  const MyCodeBlock = ({ children }) => {
    const isIncomplete = useIsCodeFenceIncomplete();

    if (isIncomplete) {
      return <div>Loading code...</div>;
    }

    return (
      <pre>
        <code>{children}</code>
      </pre>
    );
  };
  ```

  The hook returns `true` when:

  - Streaming is active (`isAnimating={true}`)
  - The component is in the last block being streamed
  - That block has an unclosed code fence

  The default code block component now uses this hook to set a `data-incomplete` attribute when incomplete, enabling CSS-based loading states.

- 32fb079: fix: hide download button on broken images and display a custom "Image not available" message instead
- d73d7bb: Make the action buttons in code block header sticky.
  Ensures copy buttons remain accessible for long code blocks.
  Improves usability when viewing large snippets.
- 15645da: Move code block lazy loading to the highlighting layer so block shells render immediately with plain text content before syntax colors resolve. This improves visual stability and removes the spinner fallback for standard code blocks.

### Patch Changes

- 0987479: fix: codeblock highlight flicker while streaming

- a12de57: Custom tags in components
- 83f043c: Fix: certain LaTeX syntaxes e.g. \(...\) are not rendering
- aabb9ab: Fix $$ inside code blocks being treated as math delimiters

  Code blocks can contain `$$` as shell syntax (e.g., `pstree -p $$` for current process ID). The math block merging logic was incorrectly counting `$$` inside code blocks, causing subsequent content to be merged as if it were part of a math block.

  Added tracking of previous token type to skip math merging when the previous block was a code block.

- 9f72224: Fix footnote detection incorrectly matching regex character classes

  The footnote reference and definition patterns were too permissive, using `[^\]\s]` which matches any character except `]` and whitespace. This caused regex negated character classes like `[^\s...]` in code blocks to be incorrectly detected as footnotes, resulting in the entire document being returned as a single block.

  Updated the patterns to only match valid footnote identifiers (alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens) using `[\w-]` instead.

- f34c039: fix: <br> in markdown tables from gpt-oss seem encoded or printed to output
- 11b347e: `fix: fallback to plain text when unsupported language is passed to Shiki, preventing runtime errors`
- 266fa2b: Fix word-internal underscores being incorrectly treated as incomplete markdown

  Previously, underscores used as word separators (e.g., `hello_world`, `snake_case`) were incorrectly identified as incomplete italic markdown, causing an extra underscore to be appended. This fix:

  - Detects when underscores are between word characters and treats them as literals
  - Preserves the streaming markdown completion for genuine incomplete italics (e.g., `_italic text`)
  - Correctly handles trailing newlines when completing italic formatting

  Fixes the issue where `hello_world` would become `hello_world_` when `parseIncompleteMarkdown` was enabled.
